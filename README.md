## Screens

### UserListFragment

The ``UserListFragment`` represents a screen with all users registered in the app. Contains the list of users and a FloatingActionButton to add a new user. If a user is tapped, it is going to open it's profile and all his information can be edited. Also, the list has the functionality of 'SwipeToDelete', so when you swipe an user in the list, you remove it from the list.
